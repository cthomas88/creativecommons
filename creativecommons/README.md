# Creative Commons

Here you will find the FAQ redesign I have created as part of the FAQ issues Creative Common have opened in their git repo. 

The layout here is based upon the very easy-to-use WhatsApp FAQ section which proved a popular design and interface and suits the Creative Commons own theming and design very well. 

This comprises of static HTML to show the basic layout and design of the new FAQ section, and incorporates all of the questions and answers that are currently on the FAQ page, so nothing has been ommitted or sacrificed. 

This particular version has been incorporated into a GitHubPages so it can be seen live on your browser
